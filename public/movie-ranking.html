<h1>The Best Movies According to Joshua</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Marvel Cinematic Universe movies</h3>
<p>These are a bunch of movies from the MCU. They have a special place in my heart because I grew up watching superheroes.</p>
<h3>John Wick Trilogy (1-4)</h3>
<p>I really like these films. The action, the characterization and the narrative overall across the movies is just fantastic</p>
<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>This one of my favorite movies because it really has a unique approach to the heist genre, thanks to the development of the characters, the narrative and the action sequences.</p>
